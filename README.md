"Resource Allocation Methods for Optical Networks as a Service" is a joint research team between:

- Universidad de la República (Uruguay) 
- Federal University of Rio de Janeiro -- UFRJ (Brazil)
- IMT Atlantique (France)

The project was conceived in 2022 and officially started in January 2023, being financially supported for 2 years up until December 2024.

## Goal

Provide a framework facilitating slicing on the fly to answer “Beyond 5G” (B5G) services requirements. 

To achieve such a goal, the project is divided into three work packages: 

- (WP1) Model-driven mechanisms: We will focus on analytical methods for solving the problem of on-demand resource allocation with a focus on the optical access network, as stated before, and with stochastic demand. We will focus on approaches using Markov Decision Processes.

- (WP2) Data-driven mechanisms: In this part of the project, we will focus on AIML methods, in particular reinforcement learning, Neural Network based methods, and deep reinforcement learning to solve problems formulated in this first part of the project at a large scale and for heterogeneous service requirements.

- (WP3) Testbed and Integration: This WP will be in charge of the construction and the consolidation of a data set, the implementation of the testbed, including either the 5G air interface transmission or emulated radio access network functionalities. Finally, in this WP, we will integrate the algorithms developed in WP1 and WP2.
